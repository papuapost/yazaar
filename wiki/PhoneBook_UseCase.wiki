#summary Use case describing the example phonebook application (Issue 13)

=== Narrative ===

The Heart of Gold takes on a new crew member, so Trillian brings up the ship's phone book directory. To be sure Marvin hasn't already added the newbie, Trillian makes a quick search by last name. 

Filter Entries by: \[Last Name \]
|| Pr  || 
||     ||
|| No matching results ||

The system comes up empty ... 

... so Trillian selects the (Add) command.

|| *First Name* || Ford|| 
|| *Last Name*  || Prefect ||
|| *Extension*  || 5551234570 ||
|| *User Name*  || peanut   ||
|| *Hired*      || 01/01/01   ||
|| *Hours*	|| 37.5       ||
|| *Editor*     || NO         || 
||              || (Delete) (Cancel) (Save) ||

Ford selects (Save), and system confirms the entry on a view-only screen. Ford presses (Save) again, and the directory list displays, with the new entry included. 

|| *Last Name* || *First Name* || *Extension*  || *User*   || *Hired*  || *Hours* ||

|| !MacMillan  || Tricia       || 555-123-4569 || trillian || 05/28/78 || 37.5 ||
|| Prefect     || Ford         || 555-123-4570 || peanut   || 07/26/78 || 35   ||
|| Dent        || Arthur       || 555-123-4571 || monk     || 07/26/78 || 35   ||

Arthur checks the entry later, but he can't edit it, since {{{monk}}} is not listed as an "editor".
