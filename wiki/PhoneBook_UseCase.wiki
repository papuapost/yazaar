#summary Use case describing the example phonebook application (Issue 13)

=== Narrative ===

The Heart of Gold takes on a new crew members, Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent. Trillian brings up the ship's phone book directory. To be sure Marvin hasn't already added the newbie, Trillian makes a quick "autoincrement" search by last name.

|| Filter Entries by: (Last Name) ||
|| *Pr*  || 
||     ||
|| No matching results ||

The system comes up empty ... 

... so Trillian selects the (Add) command.

|| *First Name* || Ford    || 
|| *Last Name*  || Prefect ||
|| *Extension*  || 5551234570 ||
|| *User Name*  || peanut  ||

|| *Hours*	|| 35      ||
||              || (Delete) (Cancel) (Save) ||

Trillian selects (Save and Add Another), and system confirms the entry on a view-only screen, which includes a (Save and Add Another) command. Trillian Selects (Save and Add Another). The system presents another blank form. At the confirmation screen, Trillian selects (Save) this time, and the directory list displays, with the new entry included.
