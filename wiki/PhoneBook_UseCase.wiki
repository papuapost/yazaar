#summary Use case describing the example phonebook application (Issue 13)

=== Narrative ===

The Heart of Gold takes on a new crew member, so Ford Prefect brings up the ship's phone book directory. To be sure Marvin hasn't already added the newbie, Ford makes a quick search by last name. 

Filter Entries by: \[Last Name \]
|| Ma  || 
||     ||
|| No matching results ||

The system comes up empty ... 

... so Ford selects the (Add) command.

|| *First Name* || Tricia     || 
|| *Last Name*  || !MacMillan ||
|| *Extension*  || 5551234567 ||
|| *User Name*  || trillian   ||
|| *Hired*      || 01/01/01   ||
|| *Hours*	|| 37.5       ||
|| *Editor*     || NO         || 
||              || (Delete) (Cancel) (Save) ||

Ford selects (Save), and system confirms the entry on a view-only screen. Ford presses (Save) again, and the directory list displays, with the new entry included. 

|| *Last Name* || *First Name* || *Extension*  || *User*   || *Hired*  || *Hours* || 
|| Android     || Marvin       || 555-123-4568 || peanut   || 06/15/00 || 161  || 
|| Beeblebrox  || Zaphod       || 555-123-4565 || zaphie   || 04/01/00 || -1   ||
|| Halfrunt    || Gag          || 555-123-4566 || ziggy    || 04/01/00 || 7    ||
|| !MacMillan  || Tricia       || 555-123-4569 || trillian || 01/01/01 || 37.5 ||
|| Prefect     || Ford         || 555-123-4567 || peanut   || 05/31/00 || 37.5 ||

Trillian checks the entry later, but she can't edit it, since {{{trillian}}} is not registered as an "editor".
