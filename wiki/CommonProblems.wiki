=== JavaScript ===
|| (!) || *{whatever} is not a constructor.* ||
|| (/) || Ensure that the the script that defines {whatever} is being imported. ||
|| (!) || *Object doesn't support this property or method* ||
|| (/) || If the object does indeed support the member, check to see if *new* is being used with the constructor ||

=== IE ===
|| (!) || *Children is null or not an object* ||
|| (/) || If JSON is being used to create objects, ensure that the last item in an array does not include a trailing comma before the closing bracket. FireFox ignores a trailing JSON comma, but IE does not. ||
|| (?) || *Can't set the style attribute in IE* ||
|| (/) || IE expects the idiom el.style.setAttribute but w3c expects el.setAttribute. Either try the IE approach and fall back to w3c in a catch clause, or [http://delete.me.uk/2004/09/ieproto.html patch IE]. ||
|| (?) || *Can't change the input type in IE* ||
|| (/) || The type for an input element must be set at creation for IE. Either create the element using innerHtml, or try the IE approach and fall back to w3c in a catch clause. ||

=== Yahoo User Interface (YUI) Library ===

|| (!) || *this.body has no proerties* (Element) ||
|| (/) || A div ID reference is incorrect. ||
|| (!) || *this.oDomCainter is null or not an object.* ||
|| (/) || Check to see that the element ID referenced by a widget constructor actually exists. ||
|| ||  ||
|| (?) || *!TabView - One of the "inner" tabs is displaying on the page along with the first tab.* ||
|| (/) || Check to see if there is any extra markup between the divs that encapsulate the tabs. ||
|| ||  ||
|| (!) || *Object expected* (in our script) ||
|| (!) || *'prototype' is null or not an object* (in yahoo.js) ||
|| (/) || One or more dependencies are missing or are in the wrong order. Check the Getting Started section for any new widgets that were added. For example, if adding !ContextMenu, see the Menu Getting Started section for the dependencies. ||
|| || ||
|| (!) || *Object doesn't support this property or method* (in yahoo.js) ||
|| (/) || The order of the dependencies may need to be changed. Try  putting any "beta" components last (particularly !DataTable and !DataSource). ||
|| || ||
|| (!) || *: 'undefined' is null or not an object* ||
|| (/) || If data is being input from a static array, there may be an extra comma after the last array item. || 

=== Yazaar ===

|| (?) || FLEV: *Changing from List to Edit exposes the "Exit without saving changes" prompt before the edit screen is presented, but only for some entries.* ||
|| (/) || If Edit uses a select control, confirm that the data for the entry matches an select option. ||
