#summary Stepping through the YUI documentation (Issue 1)

The trails step through the [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ YUI documentation] in a  progressive, tutorial-style order. There are three trails: Backbone, Workhorse, and Special Effects.

First Trail - YUI builds on several "backbone" packages that hold the library together.

 * [yahoo http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/yahoo/]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/ dom]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/ event]
   ** [http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/17/event-plan/ Event-Driven Application Design]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/element/ element]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/logger/ logger]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/ connection]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/ animation]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/ dragdrop]

Second Trail - The library provides several workhorse packages that manage and display data.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/ container]
   ** Module, Overlay, Panel, Tooltip, Dialog, !SimpleDialog
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/ menu]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/ tabview]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/ treeview]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource/ datasource]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/ datatable]

Third Trail - Other library controls provides special effects, like sliders, buttons, and calendars, along with browser history management, and grid-based layouts.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/ autocomplete]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/ button]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/ slider]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/ calendar]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/history/ history]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/ reset], [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ fonts], and [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/ grids] (These could also be viewed first.)

The mass of YUI documentation can seem imposing at first, but if follow the trails, you'll be up and running in a New York minute (or three). :)
