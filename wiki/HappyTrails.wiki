#summary Stepping through the YUI documentation (Issue 1)
#labels Featured

The trails step through the [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ YUI documentation] in a  progressive, tutorial-style order. There are four trails: Backbone, Subdermal, Workhorse, and Special Effects. 

  _As you review the YUI "Getting Started" documentation, it's an excellent idea to cut-and-paste the example code into your own [http://www.aptana.com/ IDE or editor] and try to get the examples to work in your own environment. If you don't try the example code on your first reading, do try running the example code the first time you use any of the modules!_

= First Trail = 

YUI builds on several "backbone" packages that hold the library together.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dom/ dom]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/event/ event]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/element/ element]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/animation/ animation]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/dragdrop/ dragdrop]

= Second Trail = 

To help us track and trace what's happening behind the scenes, the library provides a logger, data loaders, images loaders, history management, and a unit testing framework.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/ connection]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datasource/ datasource]

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/history/ history]

= Third Trail = 

The library provides several workhorse packages that manage and display data.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/container/ container]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/menu/ menu]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/button/ button]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/tabview/ tabview]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/ treeview]

= Fourth Trail = 

Other library controls provides special effects, like sliders and buttons, calendars, editors, and grid-based layouts.

 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/autocomplete/ autocomplete]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/slider/ slider]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/colorpicker/ colorpicker]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/calendar/ calendar]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/editor/ editor]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/datatable/ datatable]
 * [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/reset/ reset], [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/examples/base/ base], [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/fonts/ fonts], and [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/ grids]

Including "laboratory" time to try some of the examples, each trail can take a full day. (And probably should!) 

Skimming the source code for each module is strongly recommended. YUI is a superb, professional product, and there is much to be learned by studying its example.
