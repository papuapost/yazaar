#summary Happy Trails to YUI

The trails step through the [http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/ YUI documentation] in a  progressive, tutorial-style order. There are three trails: Backbone, Workhorse, and Special Effects.

First Trail - YUI builds on several "backbone" packages that hold the library together.

 * Yahoo Global
 * Dom
 * Event
   ** [http://yuiblog.com/blog/2007/01/17/event-plan/ Event-Driven Application Design]
 * Element
 * Logger
 * Connection
 * Animation
 * Drag and Drop

Second Trail - The library provides several workhorse packages that manage and display data.

 * Container
   ** Module, Overlay, Panel, Tooltip, Dialog,
 * SimpleDialog
 * Menu
 * Tabview
 * TreeView
 * DataSource
 *  DataTable

Third Trail - Other library controls provides special effects, like sliders, buttons, and calendars, along with browser history management, and grid-based layouts.

 * Autocomplete
 * Button
 * Slider
 * Calendar
 * Browser History Manager
 * Reset, Fonts, and Grids (This could also be viewed first.)

The mass of YUI documentation can seem imposing at first, but if follow the trails, you'll be up and running in a New York minute (or three). :)
